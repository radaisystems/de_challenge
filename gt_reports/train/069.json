{"impression": "[item] Closed-loop obstruction at the mid ileum, with dilatation of a long segment of mid ileum to 4.4 cm in maximal diameter, underlying mesenteric edema and soft tissue inflammation. The appearance raises concern for mild bowel ischemia. Underlying mesenteric volvulus, with effacement of the venous vasculature. Distal small bowel is completely decompressed. No evidence of perforation at this time. [item] Associated small amount of free fluid noted at the lower abdomen and pelvis. [item] Mild nonspecific prominence of the pancreatic duct, measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. Would correlate with pancreatic lab values. [item] Cholelithiasis. Gallbladder otherwise unremarkable."}
