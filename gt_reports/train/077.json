{"impression": "[item] Stanford type A dissection arising at the ascending thoracic aorta, with associated aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta to 4.6 cm in AP dimension. Marked compression of the true lumen along the descending thoracic aorta and proximal abdominal aorta. Surgical consultation is recommended. [item] Dissection flap extends into the right innominate artery, though the right vertebral artery and subclavian artery appear to arise from the true lumen. Right renal artery arises from the false lumen, with decreased enhancement of the right kidney. [item] Dissection flap extends into the common iliac arteries bilaterally, and into the proximal external iliac arteries; the internal iliac arteries arise from the false lumen. The common femoral arteries appear to arise from the true lumen, and are grossly patent. [item] No evidence of significant pulmonary embolus. [item] 2.2 cm heterogeneous nodule at the left thyroid lobe. Consider further evaluation with thyroid ultrasound. If patient is clinically hyperthyroid, consider nuclear medicine thyroid uptake and scan. [item] Cholelithiasis. Gallbladder otherwise unremarkable. [item] 8 mm nonspecific cystic lesion at the tail of the pancreas. Recommend follow up pre and post contrast MRI/MRCP or pancreatic protocol CT in 2 years. This recommendation follows ACR consensus guidelines: Management of Incidental Pancreatic Cysts: A White Paper of the ACR Incidental Findings Committee. J Am Coll Radiol 2017;14:911-923. [item] 3 mm nonobstructing stone at the interpole region of the left kidney. [item] Enlarged prostate, with heterogeneity and impression on the base of the bladder. Would correlate with PSA."}
