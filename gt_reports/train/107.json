{"impression": "[item] Overall stable exam. [item] Multiple hepatic masses with dominant lesion in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 16.7 cm in size compatible with known history of hepatocellular carcinoma. [item] Moderate amount of ascites in the abdomen and pelvis. [item] Nodular enhancement throughout the spleen, nonspecific and most likely transient heterogeneous vascularity however splenic metastases cannot be excluded but would be atypical. [item] Suspected cholelithiasis and a collapsed bladder located posterior to the right hepatic lobe in a typical location. [item] Suspected normal appendix, not clearly visualized. No clear secondary evidence of appendicitis. [item] Suspected jejunal small bowel fold thickening, likely related to liver disease and hypoproteinemia. This is unchanged since the previous examination. [item] Nodular left lower lobe region of consolidation or atelectasis. Metastasis cannot be excluded."}
